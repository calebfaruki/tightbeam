# Tightbeam

[![made-with-rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Rust-1f425f.svg)](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

Kubernetes communications controller for agent workspaces. Manages LLM calls and channel connections via the controller + Job pattern. Credentials never leave ephemeral Job pods.

## How It Works

Three components:

1. **Controller** -- k8s controller, one per workspace namespace. Serves gRPC. Watches `TightbeamModel` and `TightbeamChannel` CRDs. Creates and manages LLM Jobs and Channel Jobs. Owns conversation history (PVC-backed NDJSON).

2. **LLM Job** -- stateless Job pod. Connects to the controller via gRPC, pulls a turn assignment (long-poll), reads the API key from a kubelet-mounted Secret, calls the LLM provider, streams the response back. Session-scoped keepalive: the Job loops on `GetTurn` until an idle timeout fires, then exits.

3. **Channel Job** -- holds an outbound connection to a messaging platform (Discord, Slack). Bot token mounted by kubelet. Forwards inbound messages to the controller, receives agent responses and sends them to the channel.

The controller is the only gRPC server. Everything else connects back to it as a client.

## Why Tightbeam

AI agents running in containers need to call LLM APIs, but giving them API keys means:

- **Credential exposure** -- a compromised agent leaks your API key
- **No audit trail** -- the agent calls whatever it wants with your credentials
- **No conversation control** -- the agent manages its own context window

Tightbeam solves this by isolating credentials inside ephemeral Job pods. The controller never sees API keys. It references k8s Secrets by name in Job specs; kubelet mounts them into the pod. The agent runtime (Transponder) knows nothing about keys, models, or providers.

Use [Airlock](https://github.com/calebfaruki/airlock) for MCP tool isolation. Use Tightbeam for LLM API isolation.

## Architecture

```
                    gRPC
Transponder ──────────────> Controller ─────> Conversation Log (PVC)
                              │
                    gRPC      │  creates k8s Jobs
              ┌───────────────┤
              │               │
         LLM Job         Channel Job
         (api key          (bot token
          mounted)          mounted)
              │               │
              v               v
         Anthropic API    Discord/Slack
```

The controller watches CRDs to know which models and channels are available. When a turn arrives, it enqueues a `TurnAssignment`. The LLM Job pulls it via `GetTurn` (blocking long-poll), calls the LLM, and streams results back via `StreamTurnResult`. The controller appends the response to conversation history and forwards events to the caller.

## CRDs

### TightbeamModel

Declares an available LLM model. The controller creates LLM Jobs from these.

```yaml
apiVersion: tightbeam.dev/v1
kind: TightbeamModel
metadata:
  name: claude-sonnet
  namespace: workspace-my-ws
spec:
  provider: anthropic
  model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
  description: "Fast, capable model for code tasks"
  maxTokens: 8192
  secretName: llm-anthropic-key
  image: ghcr.io/calebfaruki/tightbeam-llm-job:latest
  idleTimeout: 300
```

The `secretName` references a k8s Secret containing `provider`, `model`, `api-key`, and optionally `max-tokens` as individual keys. Kubelet mounts it into the LLM Job at `/run/secrets/llm/`.

### TightbeamChannel

Declares a channel connection. The controller creates Channel Jobs from these.

```yaml
apiVersion: tightbeam.dev/v1
kind: TightbeamChannel
metadata:
  name: discord-bot
  namespace: workspace-my-ws
spec:
  type: discord
  secretName: discord-bot-token
  image: ghcr.io/calebfaruki/tightbeam-channel-discord:latest
  targetModel: claude-sonnet
```

## gRPC Protocol

Single service: `tightbeam.v1.TightbeamController`. Proto definition at `crates/tightbeam-proto/proto/tightbeam/v1/tightbeam.proto`.

### RPCs

| RPC | Caller | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| `GetTurn` | LLM Job | Long-poll. Blocks until a turn is ready. Job sets gRPC deadline as idle timeout. |
| `StreamTurnResult` | LLM Job | Streams response chunks (content deltas, tool calls) back to the controller. |
| `Turn` | Transponder | Sends messages, receives streaming LLM response events. |
| `ListModels` | Transponder | Returns available models from CRDs. |
| `ChannelStream` | Channel Job | Bidirectional stream. Inbound user messages in, agent responses out. |

### Turn Flow

1. Transponder calls `Turn` with new messages
2. Controller appends messages to conversation history
3. Controller builds `TurnAssignment` from full history and enqueues it
4. LLM Job's `GetTurn` resolves with the assignment
5. LLM Job calls the LLM provider, streams chunks via `StreamTurnResult`
6. Controller forwards chunks as `TurnEvent`s on the `Turn` response stream
7. Controller appends assistant message to conversation log
8. If `tool_use`: transponder executes tools locally, sends results in a new `Turn`
9. If `end_turn` / `max_tokens`: turn complete

### Key Types

```protobuf
message Message {
  string role = 1;
  repeated ContentBlock content = 2;
  repeated ToolCall tool_calls = 3;
  optional string tool_call_id = 4;
  optional bool is_error = 5;
  optional string agent = 6;
}

message TurnAssignment {
  optional string system = 1;
  repeated ToolDefinition tools = 2;
  repeated Message messages = 3;
  ModelConfig model_config = 4;
}

message TurnResultChunk {
  oneof chunk {
    ContentDelta content_delta = 1;
    ToolUseStart tool_use_start = 2;
    ToolUseInput tool_use_input = 3;
    TurnComplete complete = 4;
    TurnError error = 5;
  }
}
```

`ToolDefinition.parameters_json` and `ToolCall.input_json` are JSON strings, not protobuf `Struct`. `ImageBlock.data` is raw bytes, not base64. The LLM Job handles provider-specific encoding.

## Conversation Ownership

The controller owns the conversation. It persists every message to NDJSON on a PVC. On restart, it rebuilds from the log.

Multi-agent support: messages carry an optional `agent` field. When multiple agents have contributed, `history_for_provider()` prefixes assistant messages with `[agent_name]:` so the LLM knows who said what. Router responses go to a separate `router.ndjson` audit log and are excluded from conversation history.

## LLM Job Lifecycle

1. Controller creates a k8s Job referencing the model's Secret by name
2. Kubelet mounts the Secret at `/run/secrets/llm/` inside the pod
3. Job starts, reads API key from the mounted file, connects to controller
4. Job calls `GetTurn` -- blocks until work arrives
5. Job calls LLM provider, streams response back via `StreamTurnResult`
6. Job loops back to step 4
7. If no work arrives before the gRPC deadline, Job exits
8. TTL controller cleans up the completed pod after 30 seconds
9. On next turn, controller creates a fresh Job if none is connected

The API key exists only in the ephemeral pod's memory and mounted tmpfs. It never appears in gRPC messages, controller memory, or Job spec env vars.

## LLM Secret Format

The k8s Secret referenced by `TightbeamModel.spec.secretName` must contain these keys:

```
provider     -> "anthropic"
model        -> "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
api-key      -> "sk-ant-..."
max-tokens   -> "8192"          # optional, defaults to 8192
```

Values are trimmed of whitespace. Missing `provider`, `model`, or `api-key` is a hard error.

## RBAC

The controller ServiceAccount has zero Secret read access:

```yaml
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["batch"]
    resources: ["jobs"]
    verbs: ["create", "get", "list", "watch", "delete"]
  - apiGroups: ["tightbeam.dev"]
    resources: ["tightbeammodels", "tightbeamchannels"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```

Secrets are referenced by name in Job specs. Kubelet handles the mount. The controller never touches credential bytes.

## Security Model

- API keys and bot tokens never appear in gRPC messages
- API keys and bot tokens never appear in controller memory
- Credentials only exist in ephemeral Job pods, mounted by kubelet
- Controller RBAC has zero Secret read access
- Job TTL ensures completed pods are cleaned up (30 seconds)
- Each Job mounts exactly one Secret (one credential, one blast radius)
- All images are FROM scratch with musl static builds
- All images signed with cosign (keyless, sigstore)
